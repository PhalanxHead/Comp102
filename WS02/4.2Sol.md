## Question

Give a general construction that shows how any `do` loop can be converted into an equivalent `while` loop.

## Answer



Note that a `do` loop is simply a `while` loop that's guaranteed to execute exactly once before the guard is reached. Here's an example:

```c
int n = 0;
do {
    someFunction();
} while (n > 50);
```



The easiest way to go about this is to use a boolean variable in your guard to tell C that you haven't run it yet.

Example:

``` C
int n = 0;
int firstTime = 1;
while (firstTime || n > 50) {
    someFunction();
    firstTime = 0;
}
```

This can be a bit annoying with long guards though.

Equivalently, something like this could be used:

``` c
int n = 0;
someFunction();
while(n > 50) {
    someFunction();
    n--;
}
```

In both cases, `someFunction()` (which may be substituted for any number of lines of identical code) will run at least once, even if `n > 50` is not true (which is isn't in the above). 

What's important is that there is logically always some way to avoid using a `do` loop, so you should `do` that.
