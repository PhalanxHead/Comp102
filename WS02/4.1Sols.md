# 4.1 Solutions

## a

### Question

``` c
for (i=0; i<20; i=i+3) {
    printf("%2d\n", i);
}
```

### Output

```
 0
 3
 6
 9
12
15
18
```

### Why?

Starting from 0, we increment by 3 until `i` is more than 20. Note the format string of `"%2d"` which ensures that all printed numbers have a right-aligned width of at least 2. (ie 100 has width 3 so it extends further to the right than 18, but 0 is right-aligned with a width of 2. Play with this script to see what I mean.)

## b

### Question

```c
for (i=1; i<2000000; i=2*i) {
    printf("%7d\n", i);
}
```

### Output

```
      1 
      2
      4
      8
     16
     32
     64
    128
    256
    512
   1024
   2048
   4096
   8192
  16384
  32768
  65536
 131072
 262144
 524288
1048576
```

### Why?

Same as before, but this time we start at 1 and double `i` every iteration. Note the right-aligned width of "7" this time.

## c

### Question

``` c
sum = 0;
for (i=1; i<10; i++) {
    sum = sum + i;
    printf("S(%2d) = %2d\n", i, sum);
}
```

### Output

```
S( 1) =  1
S( 2) =  3
S( 3) =  6
S( 4) = 10
S( 5) = 15
S( 6) = 21
S( 7) = 28
S( 8) = 36
S( 9) = 45
```

### Why?

This time we're adding `i` to `sum` and printing what we added (in the parens) and the running total.

## d

### Question

```c
for (i=0; i<8; i++) {
    for (j=i+1; j<8; j+=3) {
        printf("i=%d, j=%d\n", i, j);
    }
}
```

### Output

```
i=0, j=1
i=0, j=4
i=0, j=7
i=1, j=2
i=1, j=5
i=2, j=3
i=2, j=6
i=3, j=4
i=3, j=7
i=4, j=5
i=5, j=6
i=6, j=7
```

### Why?

`j` is defined to start at `i+1`. As `i` approaches 8, less iterations are required to get `j` to exceed 8. Everything in the first `for` loop is completed before `i` is incremented, so `j` is increased several times before `i` is.

## e

### Question

```c
for (i=0; i<8; i++) {
    for (j=i+1; j<8; j+=3) {
        if (i+j==7) {
            break;
        }
        printf("i=%d, j=%d\n", i, j);
    }
}
```

### Output

```
i=0, j=1
i=0, j=4
i=1, j=2
i=1, j=5
i=2, j=3
i=2, j=6
i=4, j=5
i=5, j=6
i=6, j=7
```

### Why?

This time before printing, we check and see if `i+j==7`. If it does, then we `break` the inner for loop, without printing the result. It's the same loop as in `d`, but `i=0, j=7` isn't printed this time.

## f

### Question

``` c
j = 5;
for (i=0; i<j; i++) {
    printf("i=%d, j=%d\n", i, j);
}
```

### Output

```
i=0, j=5
i=1, j=5
i=2, j=5
i=3, j=5
i=4, j=5
```

### Why?

The guard in this case is `i<j`, which means the code block in `for` is executed only when `i<j`, ie it stops when `i>=j`.

This is why `i=5, j=5` isn't printed.

## g

### Question

```c
j = 5;
for (i=0; i<j; j++) {
    printf("i=%d, j=%d\n", i, j);
}
```

### Output

```
i=0, j=5
i=0, j=6
i=0, j=7
i=0, j=8
i=0, j=9
i=0, j=10
i=0, j=11
i=0, j=12
i=0, j=13
i=0, j=14
...
```

### Why?

This time, instead of incrementing `i`, we're incrementing `j`, but the guard is the same.
What this means is that `i` is **never** greater than `j`, so the for loop runs forever. Be very careful when you're doing something like this, that you increment the correct variable!
